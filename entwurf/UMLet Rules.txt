The “Origin” element
====================

In UMLet, each element’s position is saved relative to the upper left corner of the screen.
This means that simply moving the diagram around updates the position of every element in the diagram.

In order to avoid cluttering the history with many meaningless changes, we impose the following rule:
**In every commit, the diagram shall be positioned such that the “Origin” element is in the upper left corner of the screen (has position 0;0).**

This rule becomes effective beginning with the commit that adds this document.

The following paragraphs are informative.

Note: Originally, it was intended that one of the “real” elements be declared the origin of tho document (specifically, the “View” element).
However, this proved impossible since UMLet does not allow negative coordinates, and thus each addition of elements to the left of the origin moves the diagram,
regardless of the actually visible area in UMLet.

Obviously, the “Origin” element must not be moved relative to the rest of the diagram, since this will have the same effect as moving the entire diagram.

Colons and spaces
=================

The colon (‘:’) separates an element and its type. In these cases, it shall always be followed by a single space, except where the element is anonymous:

    method(param: Type, :Type): Type
    method(:Type): Type
    parameter: Type
